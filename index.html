        1. My first graph, Count per Genre, answers my boss's question about how many titles per genre.
        My graph shows the genres on the y axis and the count on the x axis, with the Movie Count printed at
          end of each bar. My second graph, Average Movie Duration per Year, shows the average duration on the
          y axis and the year on the x axis. You can change the end date of the chart to add more or fewer years
          to the chart in total. The overall trend in movie duration averages can be observed
          looking at the changing bar lines over time. The final graph shows the links between actors who acted
          in movies together in the year 2020. The reason I chose to limit it to 2020 is because there are
          many many data points and the network would be a little too cluttered if it had more data. This could
          be altered in the future, but my graph does answer the question of learning about the cast.

        2. 1. D3 makes it easy to put data into preset data visualization formats. Any bar chart, graph network,
        line chart, etc. D3 makes it so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. 2. It was really easy to add
        colors to my charts. The blue gradient on graph1 barchart is pretty and easy to add. 3. D3 was
        helpful to use because there is a lot of online documentation about it. I didn't have too much trouble
        finding online help when I ran into a D3 specific issue, which is really important when coding with
        a new framework.
        <br>
        3. 1. At times D3 can be confusing with all of the .addOns. I wasn't sure exactly how to add a tooltip
        and it took me a long time to figure out how to. I also think the way we did the lab was a little confusing
        for learning D3. I don't know that I fully understand the point of creating an svg or a title, for example,
        and then adding .text to it later on after initializing it before. Why not initialize it and add the text
        all at once? 2. Although the online help was nice to have when I got stuck, I found that a lot of the
        help online doesn't explain the steps but rather just gives the code that worked for them. I think it would
        be much more helpful to create visualizations with a resource that is better documented and has more
        online explanations. 3. One of the hardest things for me was getting the graphs (specifically the
        network graph) to stay on the page. I wish that the network graph were easier to manipulate and more
        intuitive.
        <br>
        4. I really tried to keep in mind the accessibility of my dashboard as I was creating it. One of
        the deliberate choices I made was to create a dropdown that a screenreader couldd read through
        rather than a sliding scale, even though that might have made more sense visually considering my
        dropdown has a ton of years. Another choice I made was to not use too many colors, since I didn't
        really need them to convey my meaning. As the readings mention, adding colors can be really helpful,
        but adding them unnecessarily can make things confusing and a lot of people who are colorblind can
        miss out on information conveyed by color. One other thing that would have made my second graph
        more accessible was to add text of the duration (mins) above each bar so that a screenreader could
        read over the value of each bar. Right now it's just a bar that has to be visually scanned to
        gain insight from the plot. I don't know if screenreaders can read the mouseover data on the
        nodes of my network graph, either. I'm not sure how tooltips work for assistive devices, but I
        did think about this as I was creating my graph.
        <br>
        5. One of the biggest factors that kept me from taking steps for accessibility in this project was time.
        I was not super familiar with html/js/css/d3
        prior to this project, so it took me a lot of time to get used to the tools. I
        wish that I had more time to look into how to add numbers to my bar chart and captions to my graphs
        to explain the summary of the information that they show, but unfortunately a combination of
        inexperience and lack of time led to me omitting these helpful features. I hate to give this as an
        excuse, especially when in the tech world everything is moving so fast and the excuse is usually a
        need to push a product out under a time crunch, but I really was trying to
        keep accessibility in mind from the start.
